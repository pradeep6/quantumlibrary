    "## 19.1 Secret Key Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the applications of cryptography reach far beyond just encryption and decryption of data. It is used for authentication, integrity protection and many esoteric protocols such as secure multiparty computations, homomorphic encryption, secret sharing, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical cryptography has been around for over 4000 years of documented history. But for most if it, it has existed only in the form of secret key cryptography. Sometimes also called conventional cryptography, secret key cryptography uses only one key for encryption and decryption and therefore the key must be kept secure. While in the past, several of the cryptosystems that were used did not have any mathematical basis and used fixed keys (or the algorithm itself defined the key), today most of them have been extensively modeled mathematically and security defined rigorously."

    "It, however, remains a surprise that most secret key algorithms that are in use today are still based on primitive operations of substitution and permutations. The main reason for this being their efficiency. In 1949, when Claude Shannon laid out the definitions for information theory he also laid out a measure for \"perfect secrecy\". A conventional algorithm that produces a cipher that does not leak any information about the plaintext is said to provide perfect secrecy. Shannon also described how the Vernam cipher (commonly known as One-Time-Pad, OTP) provides perfect secrecy if the key is as long as the message and random and uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most other crypto algorithms in use today such as AES, 3DES, Serpent, Blowfish, etc. do not provide perfect secrecy. However, their key sizes are manageable and their outputs quite resistant to cryptanalysis. Although it is of interest to note that none of these algorithms have any proof of security and we chose to trust them because no one to our knowledge has been able to break them yet."

    "\n",
    "Even though, secret key algorithms are very efficient and provide practical levels of security they do suffer from a major drawback that all conventional algorithms do: there is no easy way to exchange keys. This is where public-key algorithms come in. They transform the problem of key exchange into authentication. Authentication is almost as difficult a problem to solve but does avoid complications of trusting a third party with your conventional encryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key algorithms use two different keys, one for encryption and another for decryption. The encryption key can be given to anyone and made public knowledge, the decryption key must be kept secret. Although the encryption and decryption keys typically have a one-to-one relationship one cannot be derived from the other, in a reasonable amount of time, without the knowledge of some trapdoor information.\n"

This is an exponential speed up compared to the best known classical algorithm today. Further, Shor's algorithm can be modified to solve the discrete logarithm problem as well. This implies that once a quantum computer is built, RSA, DH and ECC would no longer be secure! Consequently, all of cryptography as we know it today will fall apart."
