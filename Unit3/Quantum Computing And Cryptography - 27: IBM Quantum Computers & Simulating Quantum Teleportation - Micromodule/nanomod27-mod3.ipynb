    "Quantum teleportation is perhaps the most exciting application of quantum mechanics. Immediately images of Star Trek \"beam\" into one's mind upon hearing teleportation. While it won’t be as dramatic as Star Trek, if actually implemented for larger objects it would be pretty close to one seen on the big screen. \n",

    "Quantum Teleportation, essentially allows the teleportation of an arbitrary qubit to another location with the help of a pre-shared entangled pair and transmission of two classical bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the transmission of classical bits is necessary to recreate the qubit at the receivers end, teleportation does not violate the assumption that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "While quantum teleportation of small quantum objects has already been performed in laboratories, it is unclear if it will scale or if conscious entities can be teleported. Therefore, we may be a ways from “zooming” past traffic jams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to reality, let’s study a circuit for quantum teleportation. You will note as we describe the teleportation mechanism that we are not copying an arbitrary qubit (prohibited by the no-cloning theorem) but moving it from one location to another, therefore the original qubit will be destroyed in the process. \n"

Each of the lines in the circuit is for a single qubit. The measurement operator writes its output to classical registers shown by a line with a forward slash on it at the bottom of the circuit.

    "**Restrictions:** The physical layout of the qubits in IBM's quantum processor, unfortunately, does not allow arbitrary gate operations between all qubits. For example, the CNOT gate cannot be used on all the qubits. Although this is not a major issue it does complicate the circuit design quite a bit and in some cases requiring the use of more gates than necessary leading to higher probabilities of error. In our experiments we choose to use the simulator that IBM provides. Therefore, you see a Simulate button on the right above the gates. Upon pressing the simulate button it asks for number of shots meaning the number of times we wish to execute the circuit. Since, all the measurements are probabilistic it is helpful to see an average of all the possible outcomes over several trials.

Further, res only has one bit and mes has two bits; the bit in res is shown first and mes is shown after.\n",
