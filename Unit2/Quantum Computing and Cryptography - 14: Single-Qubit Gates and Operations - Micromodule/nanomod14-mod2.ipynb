    "## 14.1 Transformations on Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've seen some basic operations on qubits. We've eluded to the ability to apply NOT and identity operations and that all the quantum operations can be represented using unitary matrices. Therefore, an operator $U$ maps an input quantum state to an output quantum state,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rvert\\psi_{out}\\rangle=U\\rvert\\psi_{in}\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some unitary matrix $U$. Since we are only considering single qubits at this point, the unitary matrices we are interested in are $2\\times2$ matrices. Further, since we restrict the length of the vectors representing qubits to be 1, we know that the inner product $\\langle\\psi\\rvert\\psi\\rangle=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the unitary transformation must preserve the inner product.\n",
