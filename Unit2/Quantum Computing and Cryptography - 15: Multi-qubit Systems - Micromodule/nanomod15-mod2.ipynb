    "## 15.1 Multi-qubit Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "As one can imagine, to do anything useful on a quantum computer we will have to deal with multiple qubits at any given time. For example a quantum computer may have a register that can hold 8 qubits at any given time. We already know how to represent the state of any single qubit in the register. However, if we can represent the state of the entire system we can do much more than what we've seen so far with the qubits. For example, we can now apply two or even three qubit gates that operate on more than one qubit at a time. We can also represent, what are called entangled qubits or EPR pairs after their discovers Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. EPR pairs are very powerful tools in quantum cryptography and the famous application of quantum teleportation.\n"

    "### 15.2 Exponential Growth in State Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical systems, the state space of a quantum system grows exponentially with the number of qubits. For example, there are at the most $2^n$ possible states of a system consisting of $n$-classical bits. However, a $n$-qubit quantum system can have many more states than just $2^n$. In fact, it can have infinite possible states!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these large number of states are confined to a surprisingly small physical space in a quantum system. Another big difference between classical and quantum states is that if a classical system consists of $n$-bits (components) each of these $n$ components can be precisely and completely described independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the individual components of a quantum system may not (always) be describable separate from each other. These states (qubits) are called entangled states (qubits) and crucial ingredients in any quantum computation. Entanglement is a uniquely quantum phenomenon with no classical counterpart. In fact, most of the states in a multi-qubit quantum system are entangled!"
