    "## 9.1 A Probabilistic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Since probability is at the heart of quantum mechanics, before diving into quantum mechanics it is helpful to first consider a classical probabilistic system. This is <b><i>not</i></b> to say that classical probabilistic systems are equivalent to quantum systems, but some analogies are helpful to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a physical system, called $S$, with some finite (non-empty set $\\tau$) of possible states. For instance, $\\tau=\\{0, 1\\}$, when the system $S$ represents a classical bit. Now assume that, for some reason, we do not exactly know what state $S$ is going to be in at any given moment. However, we do know what state it may probably be in. In other words, we know that at time $t$, $S$ may be in state 0 with probability $\\frac{4}{5}$ and in state 1 with probability $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to represent this type of knowledge about state of $S$ with a <i>probability vector</i>, which is essentially a $2\\times1$ vector with non-negative real numbers that sum to 1. In the above example, the associated probability vector for $S$ is, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{0}\\\\ \\mathbf{1}\\\\ \\end{array}\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{4}{5}\\\\ \\frac{1}{5}\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the bold numbers outside the vector represents the entry that is indexed by bit 0 and bit 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>An abstract notion:</b> This practice of using \"positional notation\" where depending on which row we put a (complex/real) number in, denotes an entirely new state, will be very useful and turnout to be a succinct way of representing a large number of quantum states."

    "\n",
    "Of course, the uncertainity in the knowledge of state of $S$ only persists until we actually \"look\" at the system. Once we look at the system, we will know exactly what state the system is in. Therefore, looking at the state of $S$ changes our knowledge about its state. Consequently, if we look at the system described by vector $v$ and find that the system is in state 0, the description of our knowledge changes from $v$ to a new probability vector $w$:\n",

Experiments with polarized photons can be done with ease, and low cost using a light source (say a laser pointer or a computer monitor screen) and three sheets of linearly polarizing filters (easily available on ebay/Amazon). This simple experiment directly leads to a formulation of the concept of a qubit and illustrates many interesting properties of quantum measurement. \n",

You will see a dip in light intensity on the screen. This is because the polarizing filter filters out most of the photons and only allows the photons that are vertically polarized through it. Therefore, the photons that are hitting the screen are now vertically polarized. We will call the light intensity on the screen at this stage as bright.\n",

    "The photon’s polarization state can be modelled using a unit vector and the direction in which the vector is pointed represents the polarization. We can conveniently write the vertical and horizontal polarizations using the notations: $\\left|\\uparrow\\right>$ and $\\left|\\rightarrow\\right>$, respectively. These are show in figure 5. \n",

    "<b>Figure 5.</b> This figure models the qubit (photon) in a two dimensional vector space. This modeling will be every useful throughout the course of our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see that any other arbitrary polarization can be represented using a linear combination of these two basis states as follows: $\\left|\\phi\\right>=\\alpha\\left|\\uparrow\\right>+\\beta\\left|\\rightarrow\\right>$. Further, we can see that $\\alpha=cos\\theta$ and $\\beta=sin\\theta$ for our purposes. Therefore, it is straightforward to compute the “quantum mechanical” representation of a photon polarized at $\\theta$ degrees; other than $0^\\circ$ (horizontal) and $90^\\circ$ (verticle).\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are called the probability amplitudes or just amplitudes. The reason is that when a photon $\\left|\\phi\\right>$ encounters, say, a horizontally polarizing filter then the probability that it will be transmitted is equal to $\\left|\\alpha\\right|^2$. Similarly, when the photon encounters a vertically polarizing filter, then the probability that it will be transmitted is given by $\\left|\\beta\\right|^2$. We take the modulus squared of the numbers here because in general the qubit can have complex amplitudes, but probabilities have to be positive. No one know why nature has chosen things to be this way but this is how they are!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read Scott Aaronson’s interesting theory behind why things are the way they are on his blog: https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html\n",
    "\n",
    "When $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are both non-zero we say that the photon is in the state of a <b><i>superposition</i></b>. And after measurement, the photon if it passes through takes on the new polarization irrespective of its previous state."

It is easy to see that the transmission probability is maximized when the angle that incoming photon makes with the filter's axis of polarization is $45^\\circ$. At this angle, half the photons get transmitted and half get blocked. Therefore, figure 4 reduces the number of transmitted photons by half after every filter.

    "Draw parallels between the double slit experiment and the experiment we just discussed involving three filters. What observations can you make about the model of qubit that we constructed as compared to the one that Feynman constructs? Does our model need any modifications to faithfully represent a general qubit or is it \"complete\"?"
