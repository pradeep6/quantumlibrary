    "## 11.1 Measuring a Qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss single-qubit measurements. So far we've said that a qubit $\\rvert\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha\\rvert0\\rangle+\\beta\\rvert1\\rangle$ collapses to $\\rvert0\\rangle$ with probability $\\rvert\\alpha\\rvert^2$ and to $\\left|1\\right>$ with probability $\\rvert\\beta\\rvert^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics says that any device used to measure a two-state quantum system must have two states that are its preferred states that form an orthonormal basis for the corresponding two-dimensional vector space. We denote these by $\\{\\rvert v\\rangle, \\rvert v^\\perp\\rangle\\}$. Measurement then transforms the quantum state being measured into one of these two preferred states. And the probabilities for these transformations are given by the modulus squared of the corresponding amplitudes. Further, this property of quantum systems is based on empirical observations and not derived from any other physical laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we must specify the basis being used for measurement when we say \"measure a qubit\". If no basis is specified then a standard basis is assumed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this implies that measurement changes the state of a quantum system. Consequently, if a qubit $\\rvert\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha\\rvert v\\rangle+\\beta\\rvert v^\\perp\\rangle$ is measured and it collapses to $\\rvert v^\\perp\\rangle$ then a second measurement in the same basis will always result in state $\\rvert v^\\perp\\rangle$ with probability 1 because now the amplitude of $\\rvert v\\rangle$ is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss of information\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above discussion it is clear that unless the qubit is already in one of the basis states, a measurement will change the state of the qubit and the original state of the qubit will be lost forever.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, this postulate of quantum mechanics says that although a qubit has infinite possible states, we can only extract one bit of information out of it because the qubit has to collapse to one of the two possible basis states (representing one bit of information).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, distinct quantum states may have same probabilities of collapse. For example, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\rvert0\\rangle+\\rvert1\\rangle)$, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\rvert0\\rangle-\\rvert1\\rangle)$ and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(i\\rvert0\\rangle-\\rvert1\\rangle)$ all have exactly the same probabilities of collapse in the standard basis but are completely distinct quantum states that behave differently in other circumstances."

    "## 11.2 Transition Amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we know how to compute the probabilities of collapse of a qubit given its state description. For example, given the qubit $\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$, we know that it will collapse to state $|1\\rangle$ with probability 1. Another example was $\\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{bmatrix}$ where the qubit would collapse to state $\\rvert0\\rangle$ or $\\rvert1\\rangle$ with equal probability. We found this by squaring the modulus of the coefficients in positions that represent states $\\rvert0\\rangle$ and $\\rvert1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of thinking about the computation above is that we as asking: Given state $\\rvert\\psi\\rangle$ what are the transition amplitudes to states $\\rvert0\\rangle$ and $\\rvert1\\rangle$. It turns out we can compute this by taking the inner product of the vector with the state we would like to transition to. For example, given qubit $\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$ the transition amplitudes to state $\\rvert0\\rangle$ is computed as: $\\langle0\\rvert1\\rangle$"

    "In general, however, the state of a qubit can be a complex vector. For example, $\\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{i}{2}\\\\-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\end{bmatrix}$ is a valid qubit state. Therefore, while taking the inner product recall that we need to apply the dagger operation. Therefore, the probability amplitude that state $\\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{i}{2}\\\\-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\end{bmatrix}$ will transition to state $\\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}$ is given,\n",

    "## 11.3 Global and Relative Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Global phase:</b> It turns out that two qubits that can be written as multiple of each other, for example $\\alpha\\left|0\\right>+\\beta\\left|1\\right>=c\\cdot(\\alpha'\\left|0\\right>+\\beta'\\left|1\\right>)$, where $c=e^{i\\phi}$ is a complex number, are said to be equivalent. Both the qubits represent the same state for all practical purposes. We call $c$ the global phase and it has no physical meaning.\n",

    "<b>Relative phase:</b> The relative phase of a qubit is defined as the complex number $e^{i\\phi}$ such that $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}=e^{i\\phi}\\frac{\\rvert\\alpha\\rvert}{\\rvert\\beta\\rvert}$. Note that $\\rvert e^{i\\phi}\\rvert=1$ and therefore does not always show up in measurement. Two qubits that differ only in relative phases are considered distinct/unique qubits. For example, $\\alpha\\left|0\\right>+\\beta\\left|1\\right>$ and $e^{i\\phi}\\alpha\\left|0\\right>+\\beta\\left|1\\right>$ are different states."
